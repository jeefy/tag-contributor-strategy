Helping others pays off. The TAG Contributor Strategy's (TAG CS) mission is to help open source projects succeed. Whether establishing best practices and tips for projects to recruit contributors, govern themselves effectively to stay healthy, scale sustainably and transparently, or mentor others effectively, TAG CS members get something out of it too. Join this panel discussion to hear from TAG CS members what they've gotten out of giving, including how it's shaped their careers, advanced their skills, and grown their own community. And if you are a maintainer and like what you hear, you should join us too!
